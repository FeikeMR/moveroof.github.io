    <p>Real estate transactions are broken. Too many middlemen, too much paperwork, and too many fees cutting into your deal.</p>
    
    <p>MoveRoof simplifies buying and selling homes by cutting out unnecessary vendors and automating the slow, expensive parts of the process. Virtual tours, open bidding, and digital contracts—everything you need to close the deal without the extra noise.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you're buying or selling, MoveRoof lets you handle the process faster, cheaper, and with full transparency. No hidden fees. No unnecessary delays. Just real estate done right.</p>
